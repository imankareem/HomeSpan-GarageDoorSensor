# HomeSpan-GarageDoorSensor
HomeSpan - HomeKit enabled ESP32 with Ball Tilt Switch to monitor Garage Door

This is my first Repo, please don't bully me for my spaghetti code. 

This is some basic code to check if a garage door is closed or not. 

I've commented out some code that I wrote for the ESP32's internal hall effect sensors - this didn't work well for me as it was hard to tell if a magnet was close or not; perhaps a stronger magnet is needed.

Based on code found https://github.com/HomeSpan/TempSensorI2C 

HomeSpan has great documentation. I suggest reading the FAQ and User Guide for HomeKit Pairing info, espeically if this is your first time using HomeSpan.
